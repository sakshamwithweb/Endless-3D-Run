## Description

Welcome to the **3D Endless Runner Game**! This is an exciting and visually stunning endless runner game where you control a cube navigating through a futuristic neon-themed environment. Your objective is to jump over boxes and avoid falling down. The game is built with **ammo.js**, **three.js**, and standard **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This game is designed to keep players engaged by testing their reflexes and ability to avoid gaps while moving forward in a dynamically generated world.

## Features

- **Neon-themed Environment**: A glowing, futuristic world that sets a vibrant tone for the game.
- **Endless Gameplay**: The world generates procedurally, ensuring endless gameplay and a fresh experience with each playthrough.
- **Auto-Forward Movement**: The cube moves forward automatically, requiring the player to react quickly to obstacles.
- **Jump Mechanic**: Players can control the cube to jump over obstacles (boxes) and prevent falling off the platform.
- **Physics Engine**: Uses **ammo.js** to handle the physics and collision detection, ensuring smooth gameplay and accurate mechanics.
- **3D Graphics**: The game is rendered using **three.js**, creating a rich 3D environment with modern visual effects.

## Installation

To get the game on your browser, follow these steps:

## Gameplay

1. **Objective**: Your goal is to survive as long as possible without falling off the platform. You control a cube that automatically moves forward, and you must jump over boxes to avoid falling.
   
2. **Controls**:
    - Use the **space bar** to make your cube jump and move your mouse to change direction.
    - The cube moves forward automatically, but you need to time your jumps to gaps.

3. **Scoring**:
    - Your score is based on how long you survive in the game.
    - Every successful jump increases your score.
    - The longer you survive, the more difficult the game becomes as obstacles appear faster.

## Technologies Used

- **three.js**: A 3D library that powers the graphics and rendering engine for the game.
- **ammo.js**: A physics engine used to simulate realistic physics and collision detection.
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: The foundation of the game, using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for game logic.

## Game Design

- **Environment**: The game features a neon-lit futuristic world with glowing platforms and obstacles. The world is procedurally generated, so each playthrough feels unique.
- **Obstacles**: The primary obstacles in the game are boxes placed on the path of the player. The player must jump over them to avoid falling off.
- **Physics**: The physics engine (ammo.js) handles interactions such as collisions, gravity, and jumping mechanics to ensure a smooth experience.
